            <summary>Two copies of letters the second of which incomplete (it would have continued on the following leaf, which was torn) written in Pistoia in 1539. The first was written by the Commissari del sale, possibly addressed to the grand-duke of Tuscany. In the letter, the officers complain about the fact that many citizens tend to buy salt outside of their jurisdiction, which was considered illegal at the time, and try and offer a solution. They recommended that the salt extracted from the salt-mines of Pistoia be distributed to the various villages in the area for a small price, to prevent people from buying it elsewhere. The second letter, perhaps written by an officer of the grand-duke, addresses the problem raised by the Commissari, acknowledges the excessive taxation on salt, and gives a partial approval on the measures promoted by the Commissari.</summary>
