            <summary>Letter from Emperor Charles V, writing as King of Spain, to the Duke of Arcos. Charles states that it is well known how greatly he desires a universal peace in Christendom and how much he has worked to achieve it by setting at liberty the King of France and in other ways not to his advantage, but far from attaining his end his enemies grow bolder every day and are at present blockading the Kingdom of Naples and preparing to occupy Sicily. His ministers impolore his personal intervention to save these countries of his inheritance from the infidel, and he has therefore decided to go to aid them and the King of Hungary who is likewise threatened, and his gives his orders to the Duke to make the necessary preparations for a campaign before the end of April.</summary>
